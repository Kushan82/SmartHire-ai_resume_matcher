# === CORE DEPENDENCIES ===
pandas                          # For structured data handling and dataframes
numpy                           # Numerical operations and vector handling

# === TEXT EXTRACTION ===
python-docx                     # Extract text from .docx resumes/JDs
PyMuPDF                         # High-performance PDF text extraction (faster than pdfminer)
beautifulsoup4                  # Optional: Clean up messy HTML in resumes or job posts

# === NLP AND TEXT PROCESSING ===
nltk                            # Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming
spacy                           # Named Entity Recognition, part-of-speech tagging
scikit-learn                    # TF-IDF vectorizer, cosine similarity, machine learning models
sentence-transformers           # Pretrained BERT-based embeddings (for deep semantic similarity)

# === RANKING & MATCHING ===
faiss-cpu                       # For fast similarity search over large vector spaces

# === FRONTEND (OPTIONAL) ===
streamlit                       # Easy and fast web app interface (optional but great for demo)

# === UTILITY & LOGGING ===
tqdm                            # Progress bars during data loading or training
pyyaml                          # For reading config.yaml
loguru                          # Cleaner logging instead of print/debug clutter

# === DOWNLOAD MODELS ===
transformers                    # (Optional) For using or fine-tuning large language models
pandas
